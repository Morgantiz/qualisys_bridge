# Qualisys Bridge

Author: Carlo Morganti

# Description

A Qualisys Tracking System bridge for the ROS 2 framework.
This is a ROS 2 package that contains a ROS 2 node to bridge the Qualisys Tracking System 6 DOF bodies into topics or tf transformations.
This repository also contains settings to create a Docker container with everything needed to use package inside.
The use of the Docker container allows the possibility to not include the package in a ROS 2 workspace but use it as a standalone.
